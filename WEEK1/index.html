				<td rowspan="2">The exterior of a Mercedes-AMG is required to combine striking design with Driving Performance. The Mercedes-AMG E 63 S 4MATIC+ fulfills this function particularly effectively. The powerdomes on the inboard hood, which is familiar from the Mercedes-AMG GT, and the flared wings highlight the power that is on tap in the E 63 S. Apart from their dynamic looks, the particularly low air inlets also provide for a controlled air flow – in pursuit of maximum Driving Performance.</td>
